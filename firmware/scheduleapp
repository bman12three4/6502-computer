TODO for schedule app

- Some way too show the nearest bus stop to each location (manually entered)
   * If you click on it or tap it with a finger then it could change to bus mode
     either for that class or for all classes
- A way of saying that a user does not exist and redirecting either to the home page
  or the create user page.
    * "The user "$user" does not exist. Would you like to create it? [Create User][Go Back]"






- [DONE] JSON creator: easily make or change schedules
   * Name, Course, Location (bus stop?), start and end (text and number), and color
   * It should show them as they are being created
   * A way to pick colors from a color wheel or palette would be nice
   * It should be able to show the whole week or a single day
   * It looks like the easiest way to do this without installing too much extra is to 
     have a javascript thing that creates the schedule as an object, then use 
     stringify to convert it to a string and send that to a php script which will
     save it to a file. There needs to be a way to make sure that no hackers can 
     upload a file that would hack the server or something though.
- [DONE] Multiple schedules for multiple people
   * probably as some sort of url extension ("&user=x") or something
     so that when downloaded to a phone, you do not have to type anything
